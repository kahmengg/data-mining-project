Overview
This project focuses on data exploration, visualization, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation for a classification task. Various machine learning models are trained and fine-tuned to achieve optimal performance.

Data Exploration
In this section, the raw dataset is analyzed to understand its structure, features, and potential issues.

Data Visualizations
Visualizations are created using matplotlib and seaborn to extract insights from the dataset:

Histograms – For distribution analysis of numerical features.
Scatter Plots – To understand relationships between variables.
Box Plots – To identify outliers.
Correlation Heatmaps – To visualize feature relationships.
Bar Charts – For categorical data distribution analysis.
Data Preparation
To ensure data quality and consistency, the following preprocessing steps are performed:

Data Cleaning
Removal of irrelevant or redundant columns.
Fixing inconsistent data entries (e.g., typos, formatting).
Handling Missing Values
Dropping rows/columns with excessive null values.
Imputing missing values using mean, median, or mode.
Data Transformation
Normalization or standardization of numerical features.
Feature scaling for consistent value ranges.

Encoding Categorical Variables
One-Hot Encoding for nominal categorical features.
Label Encoding for ordinal categorical features.
Splitting the Dataset
The dataset is divided into training and testing sets, typically 80% train / 20% test, to ensure proper model evaluation.

Model Training
Multiple machine learning models are trained for classification:

Logistic Regression – A baseline model for binary classification.

Key parameters: C (regularization strength), solver type.
Decision Tree Classifier – A tree-based model for classification.

Key parameters: max_depth, min_samples_split.
Random Forest Classifier – An ensemble learning model combining multiple decision trees.

Key parameters: n_estimators (number of trees), max_features.
Model Fine-Tuning
Hyperparameter tuning is performed to optimize model performance:

Grid Search or Random Search to find the best parameters.
Evaluation using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Results and Evaluation
The following techniques are used to assess model performance:

Confusion Matrix – To analyze true vs. predicted labels.
Classification Report – Summary of precision, recall, F1-score.
ROC Curve & AUC Score – If applicable, to evaluate model performance.
